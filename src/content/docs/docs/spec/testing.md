title: "Testing pipeline"
---

> Reference material, synced from the compiler repo's `spec/`. The [guide](/docs) is the gentler path in.


The testing pipeline is part of the language toolchain, not an
add-on. `hale test` ships in the same binary as `hale build`.
Test infrastructure exists from day 1 because the language's
discipline (closure tests, k_max bounds, projection-class
invariants, multi-perspective stability commit-rules) needs
testing infrastructure to be enforced.

`hale test` (Layer 1 + Layer 2), `hale bench` (Layer 3
single-language), `hale fmt`, and `hale doc` all ship in the CLI
today (`lex` / `parse` / `check` / `run` / `build` / `test` /
`bench` / `verify` / `fmt` / `doc` / `fetch` / `lsp` /
`mcp`). Only
`hale bench -compare` remains design-only below. `hale verify`
runs `check`'s exact analysis surface but GATES: any finding —
advisory or error — exits 1, making it the CI discipline gate
(where `check` stays the fast advisory oracle: warnings print,
only errors fail).

## Three layers of correctness

Hale testing distinguishes three layers, each with its own
tooling:

### Layer 1 — Language correctness

*Does this program parse, typecheck, and have the meaning the
language spec says it should?*

- **Parser tests.** Given source, the parser produces the
  expected AST (or rejects with the expected error). Stored as
  `.hl` files paired with `.expected.json` (or similar) AST
  dumps. Driven by the grammar in `spec/grammar.ebnf`.
- **Typechecker tests.** Given a program, the typechecker
  accepts or rejects with the expected diagnostic. Same shape
  as parser tests.
- **Operational-semantics tests.** Given a program and inputs,
  the program produces the expected output. Driven by the
  operational semantics document (yet to be written).

These run as part of `hale test` and as part of compiler CI.
A compiler regression should be caught here.

### Layer 2 — Mathematical / framework correctness

*Does the framework's discipline hold for this program?*

The language's job is not just "compile the source" — it's
"refuse to compile a program that violates framework discipline."
The framework's commitments need test infrastructure:

- **k_max bound verification.** For every locus, the compiler
  computes `k_max = B / [(1 − phi) * c + phi * sigma]` and
  checks that no `accept` call site can exceed it. Tests assert
  the compiler rejects over-budget call sites.
- **Closure-test existence.** For every `closure name { ... }`
  block, the compiler verifies the cycle exists (both sides of
  `~~` reference defined values within the same scope). Tests
  assert the compiler rejects cycles that don't close.
- **Projection-class invariants.** A locus declared `projection
  rich` cannot be instantiated with N > rich's bound; etc.
  Tests assert mismatches are rejected.
- **Multi-perspective stability commit-rules.** A `perspective`
  with `stable_when |perspectives| >= 3` cannot be serialized
  with fewer perspectives validated. Tests assert violations
  fail at runtime.
- **Substrate-derivation discipline.** When a value carries
  anchor metadata, anchor-self-consistent uses are flagged.
  Tests assert anchor-self-consistency triggers a warning or
  error per declared policy.
- **Vertical-only flow.** Lateral references between sibling
  loci are compile-time rejected. Tests assert the compiler
  rejects sibling-to-sibling access.

These tests are written in Hale itself. The standard library
provides `assert(...)`, `assert_rejects(...)`, `assert_closure(...)`
and similar primitives. Test programs are valid Hale programs;
the framework discipline applies to them too.

### Layer 3 — Performance

*Does this program meet its declared performance envelope?
And how does it compare to equivalent implementations in other
languages?*

#### Single-language benchmarks

A benchmark is a function annotated with `bench` (TBD: grammar
extension, or stdlib function with a magic name like Go's
`Benchmark*`). The runner invokes it for a measured number of
iterations; reports time-per-op, allocations-per-op, memory
high-water.

```
fn bench_hello() {
    Hello { };
}
```

Output is JSON-serializable for CI consumption. Baselines are
checkpointed in version control; regressions produce a diff
the developer must explicitly accept.

#### Comparative benchmarks (Hale vs. other languages)

These are **internal development tools**, not published results.
Their purpose is to give the team visibility into the language's
performance shape as it evolves — to catch regressions, validate
that framework-discipline overhead is in the expected range, and
spot when a design choice is costing us order-of-magnitude
throughput.

A benchmark file declares its equivalent in another language as
a sibling:

```
// bench_message_passing_test.hl
//
// @external_equivalents:
//   - lang: go
//     path: ./equivalents/message_passing.go
//   - lang: rust
//     path: ./equivalents/message_passing.rs
```

The runner builds and runs each; reports a comparison table.
The author writes the equivalent however they think is fair for
the comparison they want — there is no "fairness review,"
because nothing is being published. The numbers are useful to
us; they don't need to be defensible to outsiders.

Useful comparative-perf categories for internal use:

- **Coordination-overhead.** Many-message-passing scenarios
  vs. Erlang / Go.
- **Region-allocation throughput.** Allocation / deallocation
  rate vs. GC'd languages.
- **Closure-test overhead.** Same program with closure tests
  on / off — measures the cost of the framework discipline.
- **Mode-projection.** Same kernel computed three ways
  (bulk / harmonic / resolution) vs. a hand-written
  per-N-implementation in another language.

Comparative results are not gatekept; any branch can produce
them and stash them in `bench-results/` (gitignored). A regression
in hale-vs-X ratio is a developer signal, not a CI gate.

#### Performance regressions in CI

Every benchmark has a stored baseline (numerical envelope, not
a fixed value — a tolerance band). The runner asserts current
runtime is within band. Bands tighten over time as the compiler
improves; widening a band is an explicit, reviewed action.

## Test file layout

```
project/
├── src/
│   └── *.hl            // production source
└── tests/
    ├── unit/
    │   └── *_test.hl   // unit tests, by module
    ├── integration/
    │   └── *_test.hl   // multi-locus integration tests
    ├── bench/
    │   └── *_bench.hl  // benchmarks
    └── equivalents/    // external-language equivalents for
        ├── go/         // comparative benchmarks
        ├── rust/
        └── erlang/
```

Or, alternatively, Go-style: `*_test.hl` lives next to the
source it tests. Both layouts are supported; the runner finds
tests by suffix (`_test.hl`) regardless of location.

## Toolchain commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `hale build` | Compile source → executable / library |
| `hale check` | Static checks: parse, typecheck, framework discipline |
| `hale test` | Run all `*_test.hl` files in the project |
| `hale test -run pattern` | Run matching tests only |
| | (`hale test` applies the same `hale.toml [ffi]` csrc/link pickup as `hale build`, so tests importing FFI-bearing libs link — 2026-07-18) |
| `hale bench` | Run all `*_bench.hl` files (see below) |
| `hale bench -compare` *(planned)* | Build and run external equivalents alongside |
| `hale verify` | Layer-2 discipline gate: `check`'s full analysis, ANY finding fails (no execution) |
| `hale fmt` | Canonical formatter (Go-style: zero config; see below) |
| `hale doc` | API reference from `///` doc comments (Markdown / `--json`; see below) |

`hale test` runs Layer 1 + Layer 2 today; `hale bench` runs
Layer 3's single-language half.

## `hale bench` — the Layer-3 runner

`hale bench [file | dir]` discovers `*_bench.hl` files (dir walk,
`vendor/` and dot-dirs skipped); every **zero-param free fn named
`bench_*`** is a benchmark. The runner appends a synthesized
driver `main` (a bench file must not define its own), compiles at
the release profile with the same `hale.toml [ffi]` pickup as
build/test, and runs it. The driver self-calibrates Go-style:
batch sizes grow ×10 until one batch takes ≥100 ms, then the
final batch reports **ns/op** and **allocs/op**
(`std::diag::heap_alloc_count` deltas; shown as `-` in sanitizer
builds where the counting shim is absent). `-run <substr>`
filters by bench name; `--json` emits one record per bench
(`file`/`name`/`iters`/`ns_per_op`/`allocs_per_op`) for CI.
Benchmarks may print their own output — non-report lines pass
through.

Still planned from the original design: stored baselines with
tolerance bands as a CI gate, and `-compare` external-language
equivalents. The `fn bench_*` magic-name convention (Go's
`Benchmark*` shape) is the resolved answer to the "grammar
extension or magic name?" question above — no grammar change.

## `hale doc` — the API-reference generator

Zero config. `hale doc [file | dir]` renders a seed's API
reference from `///` doc comments (the convention in
spec/tokens.md): every public top-level declaration — fns, loci
(with params and their documented methods), types, topics,
interfaces, consts — with its signature and doc text. Markdown to
stdout by default; `-o <path>` writes it; `--json` emits one
record per declaration (`file`/`kind`/`name`/`signature`/`doc`/
`members`) for tooling and agents. `__`-prefixed names and `main`
are internal and skipped; a file that doesn't parse is reported
and skipped with exit 1. Doc text is recovered positionally (the
lines directly above the declaration, stepping over decorator
lines), so the lexer and AST are untouched.

`hale doc --stdlib` renders the `std::` surface instead: the
rename table supplies public paths, the bundled stdlib source
supplies decl shapes + `///` docs (mangled param types demangled;
internal-typed params hidden), and the typecheck signature table
supplies the C-primitive-backed free fns that have no `.hl` decl.
The spec/stdlib.md tables remain the canonical CONTRACT; the
generated reference is the browsable companion, and stdlib
declarations grow `///` docs namespace-by-namespace (metrics,
log, and BytesBuilder are done).

## `hale fmt` — the canonical formatter

Zero config, Go-style: there are no options that change the output.
`hale fmt [paths]` formats `.hl` files in place (no path = the
current directory tree; `vendor/` and dot-directories are skipped);
`--check` lists files that would change and exits 1 (the CI gate);
`--diff` previews without writing; `--stdin` filters stdin→stdout
for editor integration.

What canonical form means (a token-stream formatter — the author's
line-break structure is PRESERVED, gofmt-style; there is no
max-line-length enforcement):

- **Indentation** — 4 spaces per bracket depth. A closing bracket
  returns to its opener's line indent; brackets opened together on
  one line indent their contents once. Bracket-less continuation
  lines (a leading `&&`/`.`, a trailing binary operator on the
  previous line) get one extra level.
- **Spacing** — canonical pair rules: binary operators spaced,
  unary `-`/`!` tight to their operand, `.`/`::`/`..` tight,
  nothing inside `(` `)` `[` `]`, literal braces spaced
  (`Rec { key: 1 }`, `{ }`), `:` tight-left (except the spaced
  `locus X : serves P` conformance colon, per this spec's own
  examples), generic angles tight (`Holder<Int>`), lifecycle
  parens tight (`run()`).
- **Blank lines** — collapsed to at most one; none at file start;
  exactly one trailing newline. Intra-line alignment padding
  (`let x   = 1;`) collapses to single spaces.
- **Comments** — preserved verbatim in position: own-line comments
  indent with the code, trailing comments sit one space after it.

Safety: the formatter re-lexes its own output and refuses to write
unless the semantic token stream is byte-identical to the input's —
a formatter bug can mangle whitespace, never what the compiler
sees. Files that don't lex are reported and left untouched.
Formatting is idempotent; the corpus test
(`hale-syntax/tests/fmt_corpus.rs`) holds every fixture example and
stdlib source to both properties.

## Test assertion library

Provided by `std::test`. Not a separate testing framework; the
language's stdlib includes test primitives.

### v0.1 (sealed m87, m88)

Three primitives, all written purely in Hale (composing
`std::process::exit`):

```hale
fn main() {
    std::test::assert(2 + 2 == 4, "trivial arithmetic");
    std::test::assert_eq_int(answer(), 42, "answer");
    std::test::assert_eq_str(greet("world"), "hello, world", "greeting");
}
```

The test-runner contract is exit-code based:

- **Pass** = exit 0 with **no stdout**. A test program that
  runs to completion silently has passed.
- **Fail** = non-zero exit code with `ASSERTION FAILED: <msg>`
  (and, for `assert_eq_*`, `expected: X / actual: Y`) on
  stdout. The first failure short-circuits — `std::process::exit`
  terminates immediately.

A `.hl` test program is just an ordinary Hale binary. The
current test runner is the Rust integration harness in
`crates/hale-codegen/tests/`; future `hale test` CLI runs
the same `.hl` programs unchanged.

### What landed vs what's still aspirational

| Surface | Status |
|---|---|
| `std::test::assert(cond, msg)` | sealed m87 |
| `std::test::assert_eq_int(actual, expected, msg)` | sealed m87 |
| `std::test::assert_eq_str(actual, expected, msg)` | sealed m87 |
| `assert_neq` / `assert_neq_int` / `assert_neq_str` | not shipped |
| `assert_rejects(...)` (compile-time errors) | not shipped — needs compiler-level surface |
| `assert_closure(name, tolerance)` | not shipped — needs closure-test introspection |
| `mock_locus<T>(...)` | not shipped |
| `bench_iter(n, f)` | not shipped |
| `hale test` CLI runner | shipped — discovery→compile→run→report driver over `*_test.hl` (`-run`, `--json`) |

## Property-based testing

Reserved as a future extension. The language's strong
type-and-discipline surface makes property-based testing
particularly natural — you can declare properties that should
hold for all inputs and let the runner generate counter-examples.
Not in the v0.1 stdlib.

## Continuous integration

The toolchain emits machine-readable output:

- `hale test --json` produces JSON test results (per-test pass/fail,
  per-test timing, error messages).
- `hale bench --json` produces JSON benchmark output (per-bench
  time, allocations, comparative table if `-compare` given).
- `hale check --json` produces JSON diagnostics.

CI consumes the JSON; standard reporters (JUnit XML, GitHub
Actions annotations, etc.) are downstream conversions.

## What writing this surfaces (for resolution)

1. **`bench` annotation: keyword, attribute, or naming convention?**
   Go uses `BenchmarkName`. Rust uses `#[bench]`. Hale has
   neither attributes nor magic-name conventions yet. Decision
   pending; probably an attribute (`@bench fn ...`) added to
   the grammar in v0.2.
2. **Determinism.** For benchmarks, the runtime should be
   isolatable (no GC pauses to confound; we don't have GC, so
   that's free). Does the runtime need deterministic
   scheduling for benchmark consistency? Probably yes for some
   benchmark classes; opt-in.
3. **External-language toolchain access.** `hale bench
   -compare` needs `go`, `rustc`, `erlc`, etc. on PATH.
   Documenting this clearly is dev-experience work.
