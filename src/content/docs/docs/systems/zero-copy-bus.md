## The default copies; sometimes you can't afford it

Every ordinary bus delivery copies the payload into the
subscriber's arena — that's what keeps lifetimes independent and
the memory model sound (see [Memory & lifetime](/docs/systems/memory)).
For the vast majority of topics that copy is free in the noise.
For the hottest same-host routes it isn't, and you opt into a
zero-copy path explicitly.

## A `shm_ring` binding

In `main`'s [`bindings { }`](/docs/services/multi-binary) block:

```hale
main locus App {
    bindings {
        L2Updates: shm_ring("/l2-updates",
                            slot_count:  1024,
                            on_overflow: fail)
                  where intra_machine, zero_copy;
    }
}
```

Publisher and subscriber `mmap` the same `/dev/shm` object and
coordinate through the ring's slot indices. The publisher writes
its payload directly into a slot; the subscriber reads from the
same memory. No copy crosses the boundary.

The `subscribe L2Updates as on_update;` handler is the *same line
of source* it would be over a Unix socket — the substrate picks
the zero-copy lowering from the binding, not from the locus code.

## Per-record vs. batch: the handler's param picks the mode

By default the substrate calls your handler once per record:

```hale
fn on_update(u: Update) {   // per-record
    self.total = self.total + u.px;
}
```

On a high-rate cross-process feed that per-record call — plus the
per-call handler scratch — is exactly the overhead that loses to a
bare consumer loop in C or Go. Hale's fix is the **drain** handler:
change the parameter type to `Drain<T>` and the substrate calls the
handler **once per available batch**, handing you a handle you
consume with a tight inline loop.

```hale
locus Agg {
    params { total: Int = 0; }
    bus { subscribe Quotes as on_quotes; }   // SAME subscribe line
    fn on_quotes(feed: Drain<Tick>) {         // param type → batch mode
        for t in feed {                       // zero-copy inline loop
            self.total = self.total + t.px;   // no per-record call
        }
    }
}
```

There is no new keyword — the `subscribe` clause is unchanged; the
parameter type alone selects the dispatch mode. Inside `for t in
feed`, each `t` is read straight through the ring slot (so `t.px`
reads the mapped shared memory in place, never a copy), and the
consumer cursor advances once per batch instead of once per record.

`Drain<T>` is only spellable as a batch handler's parameter and as
the thing you iterate; it is not a general value type. Batch
handlers on a foreign (`layout:`) ring aren't supported yet — use a
per-record handler there.

## The `where` clause is a checked contract

`where intra_machine, zero_copy` is two things at once: your
assertion about the route, and a contract the compiler validates.

- **Scope** — `intra_process`, `intra_machine`, or
  `cross_machine` (pick one). `zero_copy` with `cross_machine` is
  rejected: the network always serializes.
- **Behavior** — `zero_copy` is rejected on transports that can't
  honor it (`unix(...)` memcpies through the socket buffer; user
  adapters serialize through `send(subject, bytes)`).

## Zero-copy needs a flat payload

A payload you can drop into a shared slot must be **flat-shapeable**:
every leaf is a fixed-layout primitive (`Int`, `Float`, `Bool`,
`Decimal`, `Time`, `Duration`), a fixed-size array of those, or a
struct whose fields are all flat-shapeable. `String`, `Bytes`,
and unbounded arrays carry heap pointers that don't translate to
a shared slot, so the compiler rejects them on a zero-copy topic.
Use a fixed-size byte array (`[Byte; 256]`) for bounded text on
these routes.

## Overflow is your decision

A `shm_ring` binding must declare `on_overflow:` — slot
exhaustion needs a policy the substrate can't guess:

- **`block`** — the publisher spins until a slot frees.
  Right for control-plane data that must not be lost.
- **`drop`** — overwrite the next slot; slow consumers miss
  messages. Right for stale-is-worthless feeds.
- **`fail`** — panic with a clear diagnostic. Process-level
  visibility into back-pressure.

## Reading someone else's ring

A `shm_ring` binding speaks Hale's *own* ring format. But sometimes
the ring already exists — written by another program in another
language, with its own binary layout. Instead of hand-writing FFI
or forking the runtime, you *declare* that layout and point a
binding at it:

```hale
ring_layout ForeignRing {
    magic 0x52494E47464D5431;        // expected header magic at offset 0
    version 1 at 8 : u32;            // header field `version`, must equal 1
    buffer_size at 12 : u32;         // ring capacity, read from the header
    data_at 128;                     // first record starts here
    cursor published {               // the producer's published byte cursor
        at 64; repr atomic_u64; load acquire; unit bytes;
    }
    framing byte_records {           // records are [u32 length][payload]
        len_prefix u32; align 8; pad_sentinel 0xFFFFFFFF;
    }
    overflow lap_detect;
}

main locus App {
    bindings {
        Ticks: shm_ring("/foreign.ticks", on_overflow: drop,
                        layout: ForeignRing) where zero_copy;
    }
}
```

A subscriber on `Ticks` now reads that foreign ring directly: the
runtime attaches it read-only, checks the magic and version, and
walks the length-prefixed records, handing each payload to your
`on_tick` handler with no copy. Your handler code is identical to
any other `shm_ring` subscriber — the layout only changes how the
substrate finds and frames the bytes.

A binding with no `layout:` keeps Hale's native ring, so nothing
you wrote before changes.

The same binding works the other way too. If a locus in your
program *publishes* the topic, it becomes the ring's producer: Hale
creates the segment, writes the header the layout describes, and
frames each `Ticks <- Tick { ... }` as a length-prefixed record
another program (or another language) can read. Give the binding a
`buffer_size:` to size the ring:

```hale
Ticks: shm_ring("/foreign.ticks", on_overflow: drop,
                layout: ForeignRing, buffer_size: 65536) where zero_copy;
```

So the same declared layout lets Hale sit on either side of a
foreign ring — consume what another process writes, or produce what
another process reads — with the locus body unchanged. Two caveats
at this version: a subscriber sees records published after it
attaches (no replay of history), and if it falls more than a full
buffer behind it resyncs rather than read a torn record.

### Mixed record types: a raw `BytesView` payload

The examples above bind a fixed payload struct — every record on the
ring is the same shape. Real feeds are often heterogeneous: a header
plus one of several record types, selected by a discriminator, with
varying length. Bind such a topic to a **`BytesView`** payload and the
subscriber receives a bounded view over each record to decode itself:

```hale
topic Recs { payload: BytesView; }

locus Reader {
    bus { subscribe Recs as on_rec; }
    fn on_rec(v: BytesView) {
        let kind = std::bytes::read_u8(v, 0) or 0;
        match kind {
            1 => { /* decode an L1 record with std::bytes::read_* */ }
            2 => { /* decode an L2 record */ }
            _ => { }
        }
    }
}
```

No fixed size is assumed (a differently-sized valid record isn't
dropped), and you decode with the `std::bytes::read_*` pack readers and
a discriminator branch. This is the path for reading real external
mixed-record rings; the typed-struct binding stays the fast path for a
homogeneous ring.

Producing such a ring is symmetric — build a record with a
`BytesBuilder` and send the bytes:

```hale
fn emit_l2(level: L2) {
    let b = std::bytes::BytesBuilder { initial_cap: 64 };
    b.append_u8(2);                // discriminator
    b.append_u32_le(level.price);
    b.append_u32_le(level.qty);
    Recs <- b.view();              // framed at its own length
}
```

`Recs <- bytes` frames `[len_prefix len][bytes]` where `len` is the
value's actual byte length, so each record carries its own size.

### Writing in place (zero-copy)

That builds the record in a temporary buffer, then copies it into the
ring. To skip the copy on a hot producer path, write the fields
*directly* into the reserved slot:

```hale
fn emit_l2(level: L2) {
    Recs.write(24) { w =>           // reserve up to 24 bytes
        std::bytes::write_u8(w, 0, 2)              or raise;
        std::bytes::write_u32_le(w, 1, level.price) or raise;
        std::bytes::write_u32_le(w, 5, level.qty)   or raise;
        9                            // bytes written -> the record length
    };
}
```

`Topic.write(max) { w => ... }` reserves up to `max` bytes, hands the
body a writable view `w` over the slot, and commits the byte count the
body's tail yields. The `std::bytes::write_*` family mirrors the readers
(bounds-checked, `fallible(IndexError)`). The reserve and commit are
scoped to the block, so the view can't escape and the commit can't be
forgotten.

### Naming the fields (`repr:` tags)

Hand-writing `read_u32_le(b, 12)` per field is error-prone — the offsets
are implicit and drift as the record changes. Tag a struct's fields with
their wire representation and the offsets are computed for you, with typed
accessors generated from the layout:

```hale
type L2 {
    kind:  Int `repr:"u8"`;       // 1 byte  @ 0
    price: Int `repr:"u32_le"`;   // 4 bytes @ 1
    qty:   Int `repr:"u32_le"`;   // 4 bytes @ 5
}
```

Now the consumer reads fields by name and the producer writes them by
name — both compose with everything above:

```hale
fn on_rec(v: BytesView) {
    let p = L2::price(v) or raise;       // read u32_le @ 1
    ...
}

fn emit(level: L2) {
    Recs.write(9) { w =>
        L2::set_kind(w, 2)            or raise;
        L2::set_price(w, level.price) or raise;
        L2::set_qty(w, level.qty)     or raise;
        9
    };
}
```

`Type::field(v)` and `Type::set_field(w, x)` desugar to the matching
`std::bytes::read_*` / `write_*` call at the field's computed offset — so
they're exactly as cheap (and as bounds-checked) as writing the primitive
by hand. Offsets run in declaration order over the tagged fields; pin one
for a padded foreign format with `repr:"u32_le,at=4"`. The tag itself is
general `key:"value"` metadata — `repr:` is the binary-pack consumer;
other keys (e.g. `json:`) are free for later tools.

### Per-record headers and wire timestamps

Real external feeds often prefix each record with a small fixed
header — a sequence number, a producer-side wire-arrival timestamp —
before the variable payload. Declare it in the `ring_layout` with
`record_header_bytes` (and `pad_field` for any alignment padding),
and the subscriber reads those header fields *for the record it's
currently handling* through `std::shm`:

```hale
fn on_rec(v: BytesView) {
    let seq = std::shm::last_record_seq();        // header sequence no.
    let wire_ns = std::shm::last_record_kernel_ns(); // producer wire time
    // ... decode v as before ...
}
```

These read like the errno-style timestamp getters on a socket recv:
call them inside the handler, and they describe the record being
delivered. Each returns `0` when the layout declares no such field.
The layout's `recheck post_copy` guard re-validates the header after
the copy, so a record torn by a producer lapping the ring is never
surfaced with a half-written header. (A native fixed-stride ring uses
`framing slots` instead of length-prefixed `byte_records` — same
`layout:` machinery, a different framing kind.)

## The same shape, one tier down

Notice this is the same move as everything else at this level: an
operational requirement (zero-copy delivery) declared at the
deployment seam, validated by the compiler, consumed by codegen
to pick a lowering — while the locus body stays the synchronous,
portable code you wrote three tiers ago. You reach under the hood
without rewriting the program.
