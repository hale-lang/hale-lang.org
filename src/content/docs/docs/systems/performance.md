## The default is already bounded

Inside any locus method, a *scratch sub-region* opens on entry
and is destroyed on return. Transient allocations — string
concatenations, JSON parsing, format building — land in scratch
and are reclaimed when the method returns. Values you *persist*
(`self.field = ...`) are deep-copied into the locus's own arena
first, so they outlive the scratch. The net effect: a hot
`run()` loop that allocates transiently doesn't grow the locus's
lifetime arena. You get this without doing anything.

So the question isn't "how do I free?" — it's "which patterns
defeat the automatic bounding?"

## The pattern that bites: accumulating in a loop

```hale
fn render(rows: Int) -> String {
    let mut out = "";
    let mut i = 0;
    while i < rows {
        out = out + render_row(i);     // a fresh String each iteration
        i = i + 1;
    }
    return out;
}
```

Each `out + ...` allocates a new string; scratch demand peaks at
the total size of every intermediate. For large inputs that
crosses a chunk boundary. The fix is an accumulator that grows
*one* buffer in place:

```hale
fn render(rows: Int) -> String {
    let b = std::bytes::BytesBuilder { };
    let mut i = 0;
    while i < rows {
        b.append(std::bytes::from_string(render_row(i)));
        i = i + 1;
    }
    return std::str::from_bytes(b.finish());
}
```

`BytesBuilder` is the canonical accumulator — one extensible
buffer instead of N throwaway strings. Use it (or
`std::json::Builder` for JSON output) anywhere you build a result
incrementally.

## Resolve string keys to ints at boot

If a hot path looks something up by string key in another locus,
the string gets copied on every call. Resolve the key to an `Int`
index once at startup and pass the index on the hot path:

```hale
locus Service {
    params { metrics: MetricsRegistry = MetricsRegistry { }; ticks_idx: Int = 0; }
    birth() {
        self.ticks_idx = self.metrics.register("ticks_total");  // clone once
    }
    fn dispatch(m: Msg) {
        self.metrics.inc(self.ticks_idx);                        // zero per-call alloc
    }
}
```

## Reclaim per-connection state

The other place growth hides is a daemon that
[accepts a child per connection](/docs/services/parents-children).
If those children are *residents*, their regions live until the
(never-dissolving) parent does, and memory climbs with connection
count. Make them **flows** — declare `release(c: Conn)` on the
parent — so each child's region is reclaimed when its connection
ends. If RSS tracks connection count, this is almost always why.

## Catching it at compile time

The growth patterns above — a per-message handler that allocates
into `self`, a connection child left resident — have a static
shape, and `hale check` flags them before you ever measure RSS.
These are advisory warnings, not build failures:

- `hale check app.hl` flags (by default — no flag needed) an allocation that
  accumulates without bound: a struct / array / bytes value created
  in a per-message bus handler (or a runtime-bounded loop) that
  escapes into `self`, where it lives until the locus dissolves.
  The classic instance — a whole-value replace `self.latest =
  Thing{…}` allocating a fresh value each message — is largely
  closed since v0.11.3: inside a method or handler, the replaced
  value's String clones retire at the activation boundary and
  recycle on the next store (the struct's own bytes were already
  overwritten in place), so a steady-state replace holds the arena
  flat. **In-place mutation** (`self.latest.field = v`,
  `self.arr[i] = v`) is still the faster idiom — it skips the
  clone-and-retire cycle entirely — and remains the fix for what
  retirement doesn't yet cover: Bytes fields, nested compound
  fields, and stores looping inside `run()` itself (no activation
  boundary). For genuinely unbounded growth, reach for the moves
  from this chapter — a capacity-bounded `@form`, route it over
  the bus, or a per-iteration child. A `while i < N { … }` counter with a constant
  bound is *proven* bounded and left alone. Run-to-exit programs (a
  `main` with no `run` loop and no bus handler) are exempt
  automatically — a script that allocates and exits owes nothing.
  Opt out of a run with `--no-warn-unbounded-alloc`. Annotating a
  long-lived locus `@bounded` is now redundant with the default —
  the check already runs on every `hale check` — but it's still
  accepted. Use `@unbounded` (on a `fn` or a lifecycle hook) to
  acknowledge an intentional accumulation and silence it.
- The same check flags an **insert into a growing collection** —
  `v.push(x)` / `m.set(x)` where `v` / `m` is a `@form(vec)` or
  `@form(hashmap)` — when it runs in an unbounded context. The backing
  buffer grows with population and frees only at dissolve, so a push
  per message accumulates. A `@form(ring_buffer)` / `@form(lru_cache)`
  is cap-bounded and never flagged; switching to one (or bounding the
  loop) is the fix. (Detection reads the receiver's *declared* type, so
  it sees `fn f(v: IntVec)` and `self.buf: IntVec` but not an untyped
  `let`.)
- It also flags **hot-path allocations** (also advisory): a **locus** or
  a `std::bytes::BytesBuilder` instantiated *inside a loop* — or
  *anywhere in a bus handler*, which runs per message (a fresh arena /
  heap buffer every iteration or frame — hoist it to a reused field);
  and an **allocating `recv`** (`recv` / `recv_bytes` /
  `recv_with_source`) in a loop (use `recv_into` with a reused
  `BytesBuilder`). A plain value struct/type literal isn't flagged, and
  an instantiation outside a loop in a plain method reclaims at method
  exit — only the per-iteration / per-message cases, the unambiguous
  ones, warn.
- One structural warning: **`accept` without `release` on a locus whose
  `run()` loops forever**. Without a `release(c: C)` declaration every
  accepted child is *resident* — it lives until the accepting locus
  dissolves — so a daemon accepting connections forever grows without
  bound. Declaring `release` makes each child a *flow*, reclaimed when
  its `run()` completes. Run-to-exit programs that accept a bounded
  batch of children are fine and stay silent.

When a path really is hot — a per-frame handler, a tight decode loop, a
10k/s ingest — **certify it** and have the compiler hold the line.
That's layered, so the strictness lands only where you ask for it:

`@hot` on a fn or handler promotes the advisory findings above to
**hard errors** inside that fn, and turns on two stricter perf hints
that would nag as defaults: `.snapshot()` / `.finish()` in a loop (each
call copies the builder's whole contents — prefer the zero-copy
`.view()` / `.text_view()`), and a whole-struct self-field replace
(reclaimed since v0.11.3, but each store still pays a clone + retire
per String field where in-place scalar mutation is allocation-free).

`@budget(alloc_per_call = N)` on a fn (free or method) is the counted
contract on top: the fn allocates at most `N` times per call, enforced
as a **hard error** (this is the one allocation check that fails the
build — because you asked for it). The two stack:
`@hot @budget(alloc_per_call = 0) fn send(...)`.

```hale
@budget(alloc_per_call = 0)
fn decode(buf: Bytes) -> Tick {
    // no arena allocation reachable from here — the compiler proves it.
    // reads via reused fields / recv_into; parses in place.
}
```

`N = 0` is the zero-alloc certificate — exactly what you want on a
per-datagram handler or decode helper. The check counts the arena
allocations it can see (literals, `@form` inserts) transitively through
resolved callees, plus the known-allocating `recv` family; a loop-nested
allocation or a call to an allocating fn in a loop is unbounded per call
and busts any finite budget. On a violation it reports the count and
points at every offending line. It's the dual of `@unbounded` — one
acknowledges intentional allocation, the other forbids it — and the two
are mutually exclusive on a fn.

The same idea extends to file descriptors and resource budgets. The
full diagnostic surface — runtime residency dumps,
`--dump-alloc-summary`, the fd-leak and resource-budget checks, and
the `@unbounded` carve-out — is the operator's toolkit, documented in
[Operations & debugging](/docs/systems/operations). This chapter is about
writing code that doesn't accumulate in the first place; that one is
about pinning it down when it does.

For the resource *surface* — thread / pool / subject / fd counts,
not a leak — there's a budget you can read or gate on:

```sh
hale check app.hl --dump-resource-budget
# OS threads (pinned loci):  1
# cooperative pools:         1  [io]
# bus subjects:              4
# fd acquisition sites:      2
```

Drop a ceiling file in CI and the build fails when a count climbs
past it — *"this PR added a pinned thread; bump the ceiling if you
meant to."* Every key is optional:

```toml
# budget.toml
pinned_threads = 4
bus_subjects   = 16
```

```sh
hale check app.hl --check-resource-budget budget.toml
```

None of these run by default — they're tools you reach for when a
program's memory or fd surface is something you want to hold the
line on.

## Knobs for when it's not your code

The substrate exposes diagnostics and glibc tuning via
environment variables — `LOTUS_ARENA_RESIDENCY=1` to dump live
arena sizes from a heartbeat, `LOTUS_ARENA_LOG_CHUNK_ATTACH=N` to
trace which arena is growing, `LOTUS_CHUNK_POOL_STATS=1` for
chunk-pool hit rates, and the `MALLOC_*` family for glibc's
trim/arena behavior. The full table is in `spec/memory.md` and
the *keeping memory bounded* spec material. The workflow:
smaps-diff over a window → if it's `[heap]`, check 30s deltas →
bursty 64KB steps mean chunk-pool overflow (a loop accumulator)
→ fix with `BytesBuilder`.

## Hot-path I/O primitives

For latency-sensitive sockets, the stdlib exposes the knobs you'd
reach for in C, without an FFI shim:

- **Event-driven datagram ingest** — `std::io::udp::Reader { addr,
  port, cap }` is the zero-copy, reused-buffer ingest handle. `let dg =
  r.next() or raise` parks on `EPOLLIN` on a `where async_io` pool
  (kernel-woken, no busy-poll, no timeout quantum — an idle signal
  costs zero CPU) and hands back a zero-copy view of the datagram
  aliasing a single reused buffer. It's the hand-rolled "bind +
  `BytesBuilder` + `recv_into` + `.view()`" fast path in one handle, so
  the allocation-free event-driven shape is the default you reach for
  rather than the one you have to remember to assemble; unlike the
  allocating `recv` it copies no per-datagram payload.
- **Disable Nagle** — `std::io::tcp::set_nodelay(fd, true)` (and the
  `std::io::tls` sibling) so small writes hit the wire immediately
  instead of waiting ~40ms to coalesce. The first thing a
  request/response or market-data socket wants.
- **Wire-arrival timestamps** — `recv_stamped_into` is `recv_into`
  plus a kernel RX timestamp captured in the same `recvmsg`; read it
  with `last_recv_kernel_ns()` right after. True wire time, not the
  post-scheduling receipt clock — for measuring real I/O latency.
- **Wrap-free parsing** — `std::io::MirrorRing` double-maps a buffer
  so any window is one contiguous slice even across the wrap point; a
  stream parser never special-cases the seam. Opt-in (it costs 2×
  address space) — for the ordinary case a `BytesBuilder` accumulator
  is the right tool.

And the run-time complement to the compile-time
`--warn-unbounded-alloc` check: `std::diag::heap_alloc_count()` and
`std::diag::syscall_count(name)` let a test *assert* a steady-state
region did what you think — read the counter before and after and
check the delta is zero ("this loop allocated nothing", "exactly one
`recv` per poll").

## Build-time tuning

`hale build` already tunes to the machine you build on: native
builds compile for the **host CPU** at **O3**, so generated code
autovectorizes to whatever the host supports (AVX2, AVX-512, …).
Two knobs matter when that default isn't what you want:

- **`--target-cpu baseline`** — pins a portable **`x86-64-v3`**
  target (AVX2 + BMI2 + FMA) instead of the host. Reach for this
  when you **ship a binary to other machines**: the default
  host-tuned build may use instructions an older CPU lacks.
  `--target-cpu native` (the default) is right for `hale run` and
  for binaries you execute on the build host (e.g. a service on
  hardware you control).
- **`LOTUS_LTO=1`** — an opt-in full-LTO build that inlines the
  lotus runtime (the arena allocator, string helpers, shm ring)
  *into your code* across the compile boundary it otherwise can't
  cross. A few percent on allocation- and coordination-heavy
  programs — exactly the shape Hale is built for — and it keeps
  the host vectorization, so there's no loop it slows down. It's
  off by default because the link is ~3–4× slower and needs
  `lld` on PATH; turn it on for release/perf builds, not the
  edit-compile loop:

  ```sh
  LOTUS_LTO=1 hale build myservice/
  ```

## Where Hale earns its overhead

Where Hale *leads* is where the design bet lives:
**subject-keyed dispatch** — the lock-free bus plus
static-dispatch devirtualization turned message dispatch from
several-times-behind into an outright lead (ahead of Go ~2.4×,
and ahead of *hand-written C* ~1.9× on the same workload) — and
**contended `@form` writes** (hashmap set ~1.3–1.4× vs a
hand-rolled C table). On the fan-out path, dispatch to a
`where async_io` subscriber reuses coroutine stacks from a
bounded per-worker pool rather than allocating one per delivery.

The tight loop caught up too: pure arithmetic used to be where
the substrate showed through, but native codegen closed it to
**parity with `clang -O3` C** (loops, vec reads, hashmap reads
all sit in the ±15% band).

And the honest column: the per-op overheads that remain are
free-fn **call protocol** (~2.5× behind the compiled trio),
**locus instantiation** (2–3× — region setup is a cost you pay
at spawn, not a place Hale wins), and heap-payload dispatch.
The design guidance follows directly: resolve handles at boot
and keep hot paths on the bus and in `@form` storage (styleguide
S1/S12), spawn loci at topology changes rather than per message
(the compiler warns), and the overheads sit outside the paths
that repeat.

Current benchmark numbers and methodology live in
