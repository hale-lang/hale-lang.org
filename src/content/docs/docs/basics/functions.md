> Naming a piece of work so you can call it.

A function is declared with `fn`, a name, typed parameters, and
an optional return type:

```hale
fn add(a: Int, b: Int) -> Int {
    return a + b;
}

fn greet(name: String) {
    println("hello, ", name);
}
```

`add` returns an `Int`. `greet` has no `-> T`, so it returns
nothing (the unit type, written `()`). Parameters are always
typed; there's no inference at the boundary, because the
signature is the contract.

Call them the obvious way:

```hale
fn main() {
    let sum = add(2, 3);          // 5
    greet("world");
}
```

## Returning a value

`return expr;` hands a value back. A function can also return its
last expression without `return` if you leave off the trailing
`;` — the block's final expression *is* its value:

```hale
fn double(n: Int) -> Int {
    n * 2          // no semicolon — this is the return value
}
```

Both styles are fine. Use whichever reads better; `return` is
clearer for early exits.

## Default parameter values aren't a thing here

Functions don't have default arguments. If you find yourself
wanting them, you usually want a small record or a locus holding
the configuration — covered later. Keep free functions
positional and explicit.

## Functions are values

A function has a type — `fn(Int, Int) -> Int` — and you can pass
one as an argument. This is how you hand behavior to another
function:

```hale
fn apply_twice(f: fn(Int) -> Int, x: Int) -> Int {
    return f(f(x));
}

fn inc(n: Int) -> Int { return n + 1; }

fn main() {
    println(apply_twice(inc, 10));    // 12
}
```

One limit worth knowing now: a function value is just a pointer
to a named function. Hale has no *closures* — no inline
`|x| x + captured` that captures surrounding variables. If a
callback needs context, you pass the context in explicitly, or
(at higher levels) you reach for a locus that holds the state.
This keeps every function value a plain, inspectable thing.

## Free functions and where they live

A function declared at the top level of a file is a *free
function*. Every top-level declaration in a directory is visible
to every file in that directory — there's no `import` between
files in the same project, and no `pub` to mark something
exported. You organize by concern, putting related declarations
near each other, not by visibility.

```hale
// these two can call each other freely, in either file order
fn celsius_to_f(c: Float) -> Float { return c * 9.0 / 5.0 + 32.0; }
fn f_to_celsius(f: Float) -> Float { return (f - 32.0) * 5.0 / 9.0; }
```

Free functions are the right tool when an operation has no state
of its own — a calculation, a conversion, a parser. When a group
of them starts to feel like a coherent vocabulary, the
*[Everyday programs](/docs/everyday/locus-gently)* level shows
how to gather them onto a locus. For now: a free function per
piece of work.
