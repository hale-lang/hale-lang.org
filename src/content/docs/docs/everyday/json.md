> a type (`find_string_field`, `find_int_field`, …), and you

## Reading

Pull individual fields out of a JSON string by name:

```hale
let doc = "{\"name\": \"Ada\", \"age\": 36, \"active\": true}";

let name   = std::json::find_string_field(doc, "name");    // "Ada"
let age    = std::json::find_int_field(doc, "age");        // 36
let active  = std::json::find_bool_field(doc, "active");    // true
```

Missing fields come back as the type's zero value (`""`, `0`,
`false`) rather than failing — so for "is this really present?"
semantics, check with the raw accessor or validate upstream.
`find_field_raw` returns the raw substring for a field, which is
how you reach into a nested object:

```hale
let inner = std::json::find_field_raw(doc, "address");
let city  = std::json::find_string_field(inner, "city");
```

## Arrays

Walk a JSON array with the iterator pair:

```hale
let arr = "[10, 20, 30]";
let mut it = std::json::array_first(arr);
while !it.done {
    let n = std::str::parse_int(it.element) or 0;
    println(n);
    it = std::json::array_next(it);
}
```

`array_first` returns an iterator with the first `element` and a
`done` flag; `array_next` advances it.

## Writing

The `Builder` is a streaming assembler — it tracks open scopes
and inserts separators for you, so you can't produce malformed
JSON by forgetting a comma:

```hale
let b = std::json::Builder { };
b.begin_object();
b.field("name", "Ada");
b.int_field("age", 36);
b.bool_field("active", true);
b.end_object();
let out = b.result();      // {"name":"Ada","age":36,"active":true}
```

Nest objects and arrays by pairing `begin_*` / `end_*`. String
values are escaped per the JSON spec automatically; if you need
to escape or unescape a string by hand, `std::json::escape_string`
and `unescape_string` are there.

## When the shape is deep

`std::json` at v1 is built for flat objects and top-level arrays
— the great majority of config files and API messages. For
deeply-nested documents you walk level by level with
`find_field_raw`, treating each nested object as its own flat
document. If you're parsing a genuinely complex or
performance-critical format, the [wire-format
techniques](/docs/everyday/files) and the systems-tier
[performance](/docs/systems/performance) chapter cover building
your own parser over `Bytes`.

Next: serving and calling over the network — [HTTP](/docs/everyday/http).
