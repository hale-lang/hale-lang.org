## Arguments and environment

```hale
fn main() {
    let n = std::env::args_count();        // includes the program name
    let first = std::env::arg(1);          // positional arg 1
    let port  = std::env::arg_or(2, "8080");  // with a default

    let home  = std::env::var("HOME");     // environment variable
    let debug = std::env::var_exists("DEBUG");
}
```

- `arg(0)` is the program name; user arguments start at `arg(1)`.
- `arg_or(i, default)` is the everyday form — no bounds-checking
  dance.
- `var(name)` reads an environment variable; `var_exists(name)`
  tests for one.

## Layered configuration

A common need: a setting should come from a command-line argument
if given, else an environment variable, else a built-in default.
`std::cli::Resolver` expresses that precedence directly:

```hale
fn main() {
    let cfg = std::cli::Resolver { prefix: "MYAPP" };

    // argv positional "port", else $MYAPP_PORT, else "8080"
    let port = cfg.get("port", "8080");
    let host = cfg.get("host", "127.0.0.1");

    println("listening on ", host, ":", port);
}
```

The resolver checks the argument, then the prefixed environment
variable (`MYAPP_PORT`), then the supplied default. Empty values
fall through to the next layer rather than counting as "set."

## Where this fits

This is the boundary between the outside world and your program.
The idiomatic shape, building on the [app
locus](/docs/everyday/locus-gently): `main` resolves configuration, then
constructs the app locus with it.

```hale
locus App {
    params { host: String = "127.0.0.1"; port: String = "8080"; }
    fn run() { println("listening on ", self.host, ":", self.port); }
}

fn main() {
    let cfg = std::cli::Resolver { prefix: "MYAPP" };
    let app = App {
        host: cfg.get("host", "127.0.0.1"),
        port: cfg.get("port", "8080"),
    };
    app.run();
}
```

Configuration enters once, at the edge, and flows inward as
typed locus state — never read again from a global deep inside
the program. That keeps every setting owned by exactly one locus,
the rule from [The locus, gently](/docs/everyday/locus-gently).
