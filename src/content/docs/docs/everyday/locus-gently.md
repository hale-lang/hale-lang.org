In *the basics*, a program was functions and a `main`. That's
fine until you have **state that lives over time** — a counter, a
cache, a configuration, a connection — or until a pile of free
functions wants a name to live under. That's what a locus is for.

## A locus with state

```hale
locus Counter {
    params {
        count: Int = 0;
    }
    fn bump() {
        self.count = self.count + 1;
    }
    fn value() -> Int {
        return self.count;
    }
}
```

`params` is the locus's state — typed fields, each with a default.
Inside any method, `self.field` reads and writes that state.
Methods are `fn`s, called with `.`:

```hale
fn main() {
    let c = Counter { };          // make one; count defaults to 0
    c.bump();
    c.bump();
    println(c.value());           // 2
}
```

You construct a locus with `Name { ... }`, overriding any field
you like:

```hale
let c = Counter { count: 10 };
```

If you've used objects before, this is familiar: `params` are
the instance variables, methods are the methods, `Counter { }`
is the constructor. Hale collapses "constructor parameters" and
"instance fields" into one `params` block — the same way Ruby's
`@foo` or Python's `self.foo` are just attributes.

## `type` vs `locus`

You met `type` for plain records earlier. The line between them:

- **`type`** is pure data — a record you construct, pass around
  by value, and read. No methods, no state that changes itself,
  no lifecycle.
- **`locus`** is data *with behavior and identity* — it has
  methods, it mutates its own state, and (at the next level) it
  can run over time and send messages.

```hale
type Point { x: Int; y: Int; }        // just data

locus Tally {                          // data + behavior
    params { total: Int = 0; }
    fn add(n: Int) { self.total = self.total + n; }
}
```

These aren't rival categories — they're points on a gradient. A
`type` is a locus that hasn't grown behavior yet. When a record
starts accumulating methods, you promote it from `type` to
`locus`. There is no third thing to reach for.

## Two everyday shapes

Almost every locus you write at this level is one of two shapes.

**The app locus** — the outer wrapper for a whole program. Your
`main` reads arguments and hands off to it:

```hale
locus App {
    params { name: String = "world"; }
    fn run() {
        println("hello, ", self.name);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let app = App { name: std::env::arg_or(1, "world") };
    app.run();
}
```

This replaces the bare-`main`-with-helpers shape from the basics:
the app's top-level state and entry point now have a home. (At
the services level, `run()` becomes a special *lifecycle* method
the runtime drives — but as an ordinary method it already works.)

**The namespace lotus** — a home for a coherent vocabulary of
helpers, with little or no state. Hale's stand-in for a "module
of functions" or a static class:

```hale
locus Temps {
    fn c_to_f(c: Float) -> Float { return c * 9.0 / 5.0 + 32.0; }
    fn f_to_c(f: Float) -> Float { return (f - 32.0) * 5.0 / 9.0; }
}

fn main() {
    let t = Temps { };
    println(t.c_to_f(100.0));     // 212
}
```

You instantiate it once and dispatch through it. When three or
more related free functions show up, this is usually the tidier
home for them.

## A rule worth meeting early

Hale has one structural commitment that shapes everything above:

> Every named piece of state belongs to exactly one locus.

No globals, no shared mutable buffer that nobody owns, no
"floating" value passed around by side channel. If you're not
sure where some state should live, the productive question is
"which locus *owns* this?" — and there's almost always a clean
answer. This is what lets Hale clean up memory and coordinate
failure without a garbage collector; you'll see the payoff at the
systems level. For now it's just good hygiene: put state where it
belongs.

Next: the collections you'll reach for constantly — [Lists &
maps](/docs/everyday/collections).
