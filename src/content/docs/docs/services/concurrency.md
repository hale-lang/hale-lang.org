## Two ways a locus can run

Hale's concurrency is deliberately **bimodal** — two choices, no
third:

- **Cooperative** — the locus shares an OS thread with other
  cooperative loci on the same *pool*. It yields between units of
  work (after a handler, on a bus dispatch, on `time::sleep`, on
  an explicit `yield`). Handler bodies run to completion without
  interruption, so within one cooperative locus there's no
  data race to worry about. This is the default.
- **Pinned** — the locus owns its own OS thread and doesn't yield
  to neighbors. For latency-critical or CPU-bound work that
  shouldn't share.

## Long sleeps don't freeze the pool

A cooperative pool runs one locus at a time, so a locus that sits
in a long `time::sleep` could, in principle, starve every other
locus sharing its pool — a 30-second keep-alive timer on the
`main` pool would block bus handlers for 30 seconds. It doesn't.
`std::time::sleep` slices any sleep into short intervals (≤100ms)
and drains the pool's pending bus work between slices, so
neighbors keep getting dispatched while one locus naps:

```hale
run() {
    while true {
        self.send_heartbeat();
        std::time::sleep(30s);   // sliced — co-resident handlers
                                 // still fire every ≤100ms
    }
}
```

The sleeping locus still wakes after the full duration; it just
doesn't hold the thread hostage in the meantime. You write
`sleep(30s)` and the slicing is invisible — there's nothing to
opt into. (A `pinned` locus owns its thread, so its sleeps affect
no one and aren't sliced.)

## Placement lives on `main`

You declare placement once, against the top-level loci, in
`main`:

```hale
main locus App {
    params {
        gateway: Gateway       = Gateway { };
        metrics: MetricsServer = MetricsServer { port: 9100 };
        ui:      Renderer      = Renderer { };
    }
    placement {
        gateway: pinned(core = 1);          // own thread, pinned to core 1
        metrics: cooperative(pool = io);    // shares the "io" pool
        ui:      cooperative(pool = render);
        // anything unlisted defaults to cooperative(pool = main)
    }
}
```

- `cooperative(pool = X)` puts the locus on pool `X`'s thread.
  The runtime spawns one OS worker per pool name it sees.
- `pinned` / `pinned(core = N)` gives the locus its own thread,
  optionally pinned to a CPU core.
- Unmentioned top-level loci default to `cooperative(pool =
  main)` — the program's main thread.

Placement keys on the *field name*, not the locus type, so two
instances of the same locus type can live on different threads —
the parallelism case (one gateway per core, say).

Why on `main` and not on the locus? Because where something runs
is a property of the *deployment*, not the code. The same
`Gateway` locus is pinned in production and cooperative in a
test, with no edit to `Gateway` itself. Library authors say what
a locus *is*; the binary author says *where it runs*.

## Nested loci inherit their pool

Placement entries apply only to top-level `main` loci. A locus
instantiated inside another locus's body runs on its parent's
pool. To put a component on its own pool, hoist it to a top-level
sibling in `main` and give it a placement entry. (This is the
canonical fix for "my long-running child starved its parent" —
make it a sibling, not a nested child.)

This inheritance is also how you **co-locate work on a `pinned`
thread**. There's no `pinned(pool = X)` for sharing a pinned
thread — `pinned` owns its thread exclusively. So when a pinned
locus needs helpers on its thread (counters, a metrics registry, a
signal store — anything it calls directly), you *nest* them: make
them `params` of the pinned locus, and they inherit its thread.
Param defaults make this ergonomic — a default can itself
instantiate the helper:

```hale
locus Gateway {              // placed pinned in main
    params {
        reg:   Registry = Registry { };
        ticks: metrics::Counter = metrics::counter(self.reg, "ticks");
    }
    // run() calls self.ticks.inc() etc. — all on the pinned thread
}
```

Hoisting them to siblings instead would put them on a *different*
thread, and the gateway calling them directly would then be a
cross-pool method call — which the compiler rejects (see below).
Nesting is the supported pattern for "many loci, one pinned
thread."

## The bus crosses threads for you

When a cooperative locus on one pool publishes to a subscriber on
another pool — or to a pinned locus on its own thread — the
runtime handles the hand-off: it copies the payload across the
thread boundary and wakes the destination. The sender never
blocks. From your code's point of view, `Topic <- value;` is the
same line whether the subscriber is on the same thread or a
different one. The substrate adapts; the source doesn't.

## High-concurrency I/O: `where async_io`

A single pinned thread handles one blocking connection at a time.
To serve *many* concurrent connections on one thread without a
thread-per-connection explosion, tag a cooperative pool with
`where async_io`:

```hale
placement {
    workers: cooperative(pool = ws) where async_io;
}
```

The pool's worker runs an event loop (epoll under the hood), and
blocking I/O calls inside loci on that pool — `recv`, `accept`,
`send` — *park and resume* instead of holding the thread. Your
locus code stays synchronous-shaped: `stream.recv(4096)` is the
same call either way; the substrate picks the parking lowering at
the syscall boundary. This is how you get async-style throughput
without async-style function coloring.

## The compiler checks your placement

Two placement mistakes are caught for you, because both the
placement and the locus's shape are known at compile time:

- **A subscriber that blocks its own delivery is an error.** A
  cooperative locus on a non-`main` pool *receives bus cells fine*
  as long as its pool thread is free to run the dispatch — an
  event-driven subscriber (handlers plus a `sleep` loop, or `where
  async_io`) works. But if such a subscriber's `run()` makes a
  **blocking** call, it monopolizes the pool thread, the dispatch
  never runs, and its handlers never fire. *That* combination —
  non-`main` cooperative subscriber **with a blocking `run()`** —
  is the error; the compiler points you at `pinned` (own thread +
  mailbox) or keeping `run()` non-blocking. (Placement alone is
  fine; it's the blocking call that kills delivery.)
- **A blocking call on a cooperative pool is a warning.** Even when
  the locus *isn't* a subscriber, a blocking `run()` (a blocking
  `recv`/`accept`, a subprocess `run`) on a pool that isn't `where
  async_io` holds the pool's thread and stalls everything else
  scheduled there. The compiler warns and suggests `pinned` (own
  thread) or `where async_io` (parks). For blocking I/O gateways,
  `pinned` is the prescribed shape. This warning follows the call
  graph: a `run()` that blocks indirectly — through a helper fn or a
  `self.method` it calls — is flagged too, naming the offending call.
  (The dead-receiver *error* above stays direct-call-only, so it
  never widens onto an indirect path.)
- **An orphan bus topic is a warning.** In a complete program (one
  with a `main` locus), a topic or subject wired to only one end —
  published with nobody subscribed, or subscribed with nobody
  publishing — is flagged, as is a declared topic used by neither.
  It's suppressed when the other end is plausibly external: a
  transport `binding`, a wildcard (`log.**`) covering the subject, a
  cross-seed (`alias::Topic`) reference, or the same locus being both
  ends. Library code (no `main`) isn't checked — its peers live
  downstream.
- **A bus cycle is flagged.** If a handler for one topic publishes
  another in a loop (`a → b → a`), the cell can re-trigger its own
  publish. A cycle *across* loci spins the cooperative queue — a
  warning. A cycle *within* one locus is worse: intra-locus publishes
  are direct synchronous calls, so the loop recurses on the thread
  until the stack overflows — an error. (Only an *unconditional*
  self-republish errors; one guarded by an `if` is a terminating
  state machine and is left alone.)
- **An unthrottled publish loop is a warning.** A `while true` loop
  that publishes with no `yield`, `time::sleep`/`tick`, input-pacing
  `recv`, or `break`/`return` floods the bus — the producer has no
  backpressure, so cells pile up without bound. Pace the loop, drive
  it from an input, or `yield` to let the subscriber drain. (Bounded
  loops are never flagged; any flow-control point clears it.)
- **A subject payload type-mismatch is an error.** If two sites
  publish/subscribe the same literal subject string with different
  `of type` payloads, a subscriber would decode the wrong type at
  runtime — rejected. (Declared `topic`s are already unified by their
  declaration, so this only affects ad-hoc literal subjects.)

It also enforces the **single-threaded-method invariant**: a locus's
methods may only be called on the thread that owns its pool, so a
*direct* method call across pools (`self.other.foo()` where `other`
is placed on a different pool) is a compile error — it would run
`other`'s method on the wrong thread.

One escape is deliberately **not** traced: a call made through a
*handler function pointer* rather than a direct method reference —
the canonical case being a `std::http::Server` handler that reads a
locus living on another pool. The static call-graph walk can't see
through the pointer, so it's allowed. That's load-bearing (it's how
a `/metrics` endpoint on the `io` pool reads a registry nested on a
pinned gateway), but it's on *you* to keep that access safe —
typically a read of stable, append-only state, not a mutation that
would race the owning thread.
