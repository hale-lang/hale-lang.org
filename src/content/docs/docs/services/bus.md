You met the bus implicitly in [logging](/docs/everyday/logging):
emitters publish, sinks subscribe, neither references the other.
Here you declare and use it directly.

## Topics are typed declarations

A topic names a channel and the type that flows on it:

```hale
type Order { id: String; amount: Decimal; }

topic OrderPlaced  { payload: Order; }
topic OrderShipped { payload: Order; }
```

A topic is a top-level declaration, like `type` or `locus`. It's
referenced by name — never a magic string — so the payload type
is checked at every publish and every handler, and renaming the
topic moves every use with it.

## Subscribe and publish

A locus declares its bus interface in a `bus { }` block:

```hale
locus Warehouse {
    bus {
        subscribe OrderPlaced as on_order;     // inbound
        publish   OrderShipped;                 // outbound
    }

    fn on_order(o: Order) {
        // ... pick and pack ...
        OrderShipped <- o;                       // the send
    }
}
```

- **`subscribe TOPIC as HANDLER;`** wires inbound messages to a
  handler method. The handler must exist with the matching
  signature — `fn on_order(o: Order)` — and the compiler checks
  it.
- **`publish TOPIC;`** authorizes this locus to send on the
  topic. Without it, a send is a compile error.
- **`TOPIC <- value;`** is the send. It's a statement, not an
  expression — it produces no value, like Erlang's `Pid ! Msg`.

Subscribing is declarative — there's no `subscribe()` call at
runtime. Registration happens when the locus is constructed, and
unsubscribe happens automatically at dissolve.

## One ordering rule

A subscriber must be *born before* a publisher sends, or the
message has nowhere to land. In practice: instantiate your
subscribers first in `main`. (This is the same rule you saw with
the log sink.)

## Why this doesn't break the tower

In the [parent/child model](/docs/services/parents-children), flow is
strictly vertical — a locus only talks up to its parent and down
to its children. The bus seems to let unrelated loci talk
sideways. It doesn't, really: publishers and subscribers don't
see *each other*, they see the *topic*, which lives at the
runtime root — structurally above everyone. Every send goes up to
the bus; every delivery comes down to a subscriber. It's vertical
flow through a shared root, which is why two loci on opposite
branches of a deep tree can coordinate with no shared pointer and
no registry lookup.

This is the productive shape for events: many-to-many flow
without back-channels. A topic can have any number of publishers
and subscribers.

## You won't always pay for it

If a topic is only ever used *inside a single locus type* — the
same locus both publishes and subscribes, with no external
binding — the compiler can prove every send routes back to a
handler on the same instance, and rewrites the send into a direct
method call. The bus is elided entirely. So you can use topics
freely for a locus's own internal event flow without paying
dispatch cost; if the topic later grows a second subscriber or a
deployment binding, the real bus path comes back automatically,
and your code doesn't change.

The static-dispatch devirtualization is broader than that
intra-locus-type case: any *quiet*, flat-payload, same-thread
handler on a closed-world local subject lowers to a direct
synchronous call — even when the publisher and subscriber are
distinct locus types.

## Routing keys: one topic, sharded by a field

By default every subscriber to a topic sees every message. When
you have many subscribers that each care about *one slice* of the
traffic — one connection, one symbol, one tenant — fanning every
message to all of them and filtering in each handler is wasteful.
A **routing key** moves that filter into the bus: a subscriber
declares which key it wants, and the runtime only delivers
matching messages.

Name a payload field as the key on the topic, then filter on it
at the subscribe site:

```hale
type Tick { symbol_id: Int; price: Decimal; }

topic Quote { payload: Tick; keyed_by symbol_id; }

locus Feed {
    params { symbol_id: Int = 0; }

    bus {
        subscribe Quote as on_quote where key == self.symbol_id;
    }

    fn on_quote(t: Tick) {
        // only ticks whose symbol_id matches this Feed arrive
    }
}
```

A publish carries its key in the payload, so the send is
unchanged — `Quote <- Tick { symbol_id: 7, price: 100.0d };`
reaches only the `Feed` instances that subscribed with
`where key == 7`.

- **`keyed_by FIELD`** on the topic picks the routing field. It
  must be a field of the payload, and its type must be one the bus
  can compare per entry: `Int`, `Bool`, `Time`, `Duration`, a
  no-payload enum, `Decimal`, or `String`. A `String` key routes
  by name directly — `keyed_by room` + `where key == self.name`
  — with a hash gate so a non-matching key still costs one
  integer compare. (Need a compound key like `(symbol, venue)`?
  Pack it into one `Decimal` field or render it into the
  `String` key yourself.)
- **`where key == EXPR`** on a subscribe filters that subscriber.
  `EXPR` can be a literal, a `const`, or `self.<field>` — the
  common case, one instance per shard.
- The key is **captured by value when the locus is constructed.**
  Reassigning `self.symbol_id` later does *not* re-route the
  subscription; to change shards, dissolve the locus and
  instantiate a fresh one.

### When nothing matches

A keyed publish whose key matches no subscriber is governed by the
topic's `on_unmatched:` policy:

```hale
topic Quote { payload: Tick; keyed_by symbol_id; on_unmatched: fallback; }
```

- **`swallow`** *(the default)* — the message is dropped silently.
  Run with `LOTUS_BUS_LOG_UNMATCHED=1` to log drops while
  debugging.
- **`fail`** — the publish becomes fallible; every send site must
  dispose of it: `Quote <- t or raise;` panics on an unmatched
  key, `Quote <- t or discard;` swallows it. Use this when an
  unrouted message is a bug, not an expected case.
- **`fallback`** — an unmatched message is delivered to a
  catch-all subscriber that opts in with `where key == _`. At
  least one such subscriber must exist program-wide, or the topic
  is rejected at compile time.
