## A topic is in-process by default

When a topic isn't mentioned in any `bindings { }` block, it's
delivered by an in-process cooperative queue. Two loci in the
same binary just talk. Nothing to configure.

## Binding a topic to a transport

To carry a topic *between* binaries, name it in the `main`
locus's `bindings { }` block with a transport:

```hale
main locus App {
    bindings {
        MatchReady: unix("/tmp/matches.sock");
    }
    run() {
        Matchmaker { target_size: 4 };
    }
}
```

`bindings { }` is legal only on a `main` locus. The publisher's
`MatchReady <- info;` and the subscriber's `subscribe MatchReady
as ...` are *unchanged* — they don't know or care that delivery
now crosses a socket. The same locus source runs in a test
(in-memory), a single binary (in-memory), and a multi-binary
deployment (unix), chosen entirely at this seam.

## The transports that ship

- **In-process** — the default; absence of a binding.
- **`unix("/path")`** — an AF_UNIX framed-byte transport, owned
  by the runtime. The role (listen vs connect) is inferred from
  whether the binary publishes or subscribes the topic; specify
  `role: listen | connect` when one binary does both.
- **`udp://host:port`** — datagram transport, including IPv4
  multicast. Lossy by nature — right for tick streams and
  telemetry where stale-is-worthless.
- **A user adapter** — any locus you write that satisfies the
  `__StdBusAdapter` interface (a single `send(subject, bytes)`
  method). This is how NATS, MQTT, a raw-TCP framing, or a
  custom JSON-over-WebSocket transport plug in — as ordinary loci
  in your code, not language features:
  ```hale
  bindings {
      BrokerEvt: MyNatsAdapter { url: "nats://prod:4222" };
  }
  ```

The substrate stays neutral on protocol semantics — reliability,
ordering, retries, backpressure all live in the adapter body,
where they belong.

## Talking to other languages: codecs

By default the bus uses Hale's internal wire format, which is
fine Hale-to-Hale but opaque to a consumer in another language.
When you need JSON over a socket or protobuf to a Python peer, a
binding names a `codec` — a locus that owns encode/decode:

```hale
bindings {
    Tick: unix("/tmp/ticks.sock") codec(TickJsonCodec { });
}
```

The codec is structurally typed against the topic's payload
(`encode` takes the payload type, `decode` returns it) and must
be *pure* — no hidden state — because it runs on transport
threads. Different bindings on the same topic can carry different
codecs; the publisher's send site doesn't know which.

## The shape this gives you

A single source tree, decomposed into loci that coordinate over
topics. How those topics are delivered — same process, same
machine over a socket, across the network via a broker — is a
deployment decision living in `bindings { }`, separate from the
logic. You design the system once and deploy it many ways. The
[systems tier](/docs/systems/zero-copy-bus) adds one more
transport for the highest-frequency same-machine routes:
shared-memory zero-copy.

---

That's the services tier: lifecycle, a typed bus, concurrency and
placement, supervised parent/child trees, structural failure, and
multi-binary deployment. You can build daemons, servers, and
distributed systems with this. The final tier goes under the
runtime — memory, layout, raw performance, and the C boundary —
for when you need that control.
