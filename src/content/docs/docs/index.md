**A concurrent systems language with a model-checked, GC-free
runtime — typed message-bus concurrency, data-race-free by
design.**

*One language. Four altitudes.*

Most languages pick a level and live there. Python and
JavaScript sit high — fast to write, far from the metal. Go
sits in the middle — concurrency in the language, a runtime
underneath. Rust and C++ sit low — you own memory and layout,
and you pay attention to both.

Hale is a single language you can write at any of those levels,
and move between them without switching tools. The same file
can read like a script at the top and like a systems program at
the bottom. There is one primitive — the **locus** — and the
only thing that changes as you descend is how much of it you
choose to see.

> **Try it now:** the [playground](https://hale-lang.github.io/hale/play/) runs a set of
> curated Hale examples, precompiled to WebAssembly, right in your
> browser — no install. (Read the source and run it; in-browser
> editing isn't there yet.)

This guide is built around that idea. It introduces Hale at four
levels, each one self-contained:

- **The basics** — variables, math, functions, control flow.
  Hale as a small, clean language. You can write real scripts
  knowing only this.
- **Everyday programs** — files, JSON, HTTP, a bit of structure.
  Hale at the altitude you'd reach for Python or Node.
- **Concurrent services** — long-running processes, a typed
  message bus, supervision. Hale where you'd reach for Go.
- **Systems control** — memory, layout, lifetime, zero-copy I/O,
  C bindings. Hale where you'd reach for Rust or C++.

Each level expands on the one before it without contradicting
it. The function you wrote in *the basics* still works in
*systems control* — you've just learned to see more of what was
always there.

## A taste

Here's a small service. Don't worry about every keyword yet;
notice that each phrase you'd say out loud has a place to live.

```hale
type Player    { id: String; name: String; }
type MatchInfo { match_id: String; players: [Player]; }

topic JoinQueue  { payload: Player; }
topic MatchReady { payload: MatchInfo; }

locus Matchmaker {
    params { target_size: Int = 4; }
    bus {
        subscribe JoinQueue as on_join;
        publish   MatchReady;
    }

    fn on_join(p: Player) {
        self.waiting.push(p);
        if self.waiting.len() >= self.target_size {
            MatchReady <- assemble_match(self.waiting, self.target_size);
        }
    }
}
```

*"A matchmaker"* → `locus Matchmaker`. *"That receives players"*
→ `subscribe JoinQueue`. *"And announces matches"* → `publish
MatchReady`. *"When enough are queued"* → the `if`. The code
keeps the shape of the sentence.

That's the bet behind Hale: the gap between *how you describe a
system* and *what you type* doesn't have to be there. The
[design](/docs/the-design) chapter explains why one shape works
across the whole range — and across human, LLM, and machine.

## How to read this

If you're new to programming or to systems languages, start at
**The basics** and go in order. If you already program, skim the
basics for the parts that differ from what you know (the failure
model and the money/time types are worth a look), then jump to
the level that matches the program you want to write. Every
level after the basics opens with a short *"Coming from X?"* box
to orient you.

When you want the exact rules rather than the tour, the
[reference](/docs/reference) points into `spec/` — the canonical
contract the compiler enforces.

Head to [Install](/docs/getting-started/install) to set up the
toolchain, then [Your first run](/docs/getting-started/first-run)
to put a program on screen.
